Brief

Data provider REDSHIFT, who specialises in gathering call records, financial transactions, and ANPR sightings has been contracted by our customer at the National Investigation Unit to provide data relating to a specific scenario given. One of our customerâ€™s investigators has detained a suspect, and the customer needs to know some background context surrounding the suspect, such as their biographical information, associates, financial transactions, and their whereabouts. 
The goal therefore is to create a functionally secure application which enables the client to search through all records of people provided by REDSHIFT, so that any records of information pertaining to a possible suspect are easily accessible in the four key areas specified in the brief. 

#### Requirements ####

The data in citizen.csv folder needs to be displayed in a readable manner for each person. Ideally data will refer to: 
- Phone 
- Bank 
- Vehicle information
- Whereabouts (from ANPR, Cell Tower location, or a bank transaction data), a single location from a single source is sufficient for scenario 1
- Associates (from mobile call records)

The Kanban board for this project is available here. For the Kanban board Jira software was used and modelled as an Agile Scrum Board. JIRA has been beneficial for our project, by assigning tasks, having a GUI to organise our workflow and keep track of progress.


Network Infrastructure & Database
---------------

The database utilises many technologies in order to host our data and allow our application to run in the cloud:

#### Jenkins ####

By using Jenkins pipeline we have access to plugins which facilitate continuous delivery (via webhooks), allowing our application to run automatically when commits are made, accompanied by autonomous testing.

#### AWS #### 

The technologies we use from AWS are examples of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), where we have the most control and responsibility over the cloud services available to us. -- We are deploying 3 EC2 instances for Jenkins, our Docker Swarm Manager and Docker Swarm Worker nodes. 
- Amazon RDS Database is being used to host our data for this project. 
- Our Database is within a private Subnet and connected to the internet via a NAT Gateway
- Our EC2 instances communicate through an NGINX proxy and are in a public subnet
- All of our resources on Amazon are being held within an VPC


#### Docker #### 

Through Docker, our autonomous process builds images of our application and then proceeds to run them on containers. These containers are orchestrated by Docker Swarm, which is controlling 1 manager and 1 worker node.

Backend
---------------

The backend is powered by Java using the Spring Boot Framework. This allows rapid and simple deployment of an integration structure between the database and the frontend. As well as the database logic, the backend has HTTP requests, and allows the frontend to access the database and work with the data there.

Our Controller maps the two HTTP GET requests to our services, where our data on the suspects information is mapped to Data Transfer Objects, allowing the frontend to display the correct information.

Frontend
---------------

The frontend is powered by HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising the Bootstrap Framework to finetune the layout of the webpage using containers, columns, and rows. This allows the search method to be easily implemented and accessible to website users. HTML and CSS have been used to produce the look of the website and JavaScript has been used to get data from the database to populate the elements on the webpage.

Testing
---------------

Extensive backend testing was carried out, including integration testing and Mockito testing on all functionality and methods called in Java. This enabled the functionality in Java to be tested to make sure that there were no possible breaking points in the backend. Frontend testing was carried out in the form of Selenium testing. SELENIUM

Stretch Goals
---------------
To push the project further into scenario 3
To Push the project into scenario 2
To include information on the cell tower location and the ANPR observations to extend the whereabouts of the suspects in scenario 1. 
To include information on history of locations.
